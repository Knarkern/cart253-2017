- Today is about two new key structures in programming
- One is about leveraging the awesome power of computers not to get bored doing the same thing over and over: loops
- The other is about being able to better organise our code so we don't get totally confused

# Repetition

- We've seen how useful repetition is in _time_ to create a dynamic program using the `draw()` loop
- But repetition can also be useful when we just need to do the 'same kind of thing' over and over in our code

# Building the fence...

```java
int boardWidth = 20;
int boardHeight = 200;

size(640,480);
background(100,200,100);
fill(100,80,80);

rect(0,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
rect(1*boardWidth,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
rect(2*boardWidth,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
rect(3*boardWidth,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
rect(4*boardWidth,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
rect(5*boardWidth,height-boardHeight,boardWidth,boardHeight);
...
```
--
And then you die of boredom.

???

__Note:__ We use `height-boardHeight` as the y coordinate of each board to make it align with the bottom of the screen. If we drew it at `height` its top-left corner would be at the bottom (and we wouldn't see it), so we subtract `boardHeight` to draw it perfectly aligned.

---

class: middle

# But I don't want to die of boredom...

- This feels too much like work, and computers are meant to do that!
- Can't we just tell Processing how to draw _one_ board, and have it understand how to draw all of them?
- Yes, we can do that
- And it's called a _loop_

---

class: middle

# `while`ing away the time...

```java
while (condition) {
  // Do something, like draw a board!
}
```

- This will execute the code inside the curly brackets _over and over_ for as long as the _condition is true_
- It checks the condition, if it's true it runs the code, then it checks the condition again, if it's true it runs the code, and so on until the condition is _false_, then it's over.

???

- It's like an `if` statement except it runs the code over and over until the condition is false

---

class: middle

# Building that fence...

```java
while (theFenceIsNotBuilt) {
  // Add a board
}
```

- This is theoretically what we need, but obviously it won't work
- We need some specific elements...

---

class: middle

# In the loop

- There are three main things we need to know when we write a loop:

  - A __start condition__ that defines the way things are before the loop starts. (The fence is not built.)
  - A __stopping condition__ that defines when we should stop our loop. (The fence is built.)
  - One or more __actions__ that are carried out in the loop that eventually cause it to stop. (Add one board.)

---

class: middle

```java
int boardX = 0;
int boardWidth = 20;
int boardHeight = 200;

size(640, 480);
background(100,200,100);
fill(100,80,80);

while (boardX < width) {
  rect(boardX, height-boardHeight, boardWidth, boardHeight);
  boardX += boardWidth;
}
```

???

- Here we have a loop version of building the fence!
- The start conditions are the variables along with the size of the window
- The stopping condition is when `boardX` is greater than the width (we've filled the window)
- The actions are to draw a board in the current location, and then _move_ the location to the right

---

class: middle

# The loop

```java
while (boardX < width) {
  rect(boardX, height-boardHeight, boardWidth, boardHeight);
  boardX += boardWidth;
}
```

- The loop _ends_ when `boardX` is greater than the width (e.g. we've drawn a fence all the way across the window)
- Notice that we need to _change_ `boardX` in the loop or it would _never end_
- So we need that condition to become _false_ at some point

---

class: middle

# So what does this do?

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int currentLocation = 0;
  while (currentLocation < mouseX) {
    rect(currentLocation,mouseY,10,10);
    currentLocation += 20;
  }
}
```

- The song that doesn't end from Lamb Chop Play-ALong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNTxr2NJHa0

---

class: middle

```java
while (true) {
  singTheSongThatDoesntEnd();
}
```

- This is an infinite loop
- It is evil, because will never end, which is a really long time
- It will crash the program
- And sadly not all infinite loops are as obvious as this one

---

class: middle

# Is this... okay?

```java
void draw() {
  int x = 0;
  while (mouseX < 50) {
    rect(x,mouseY,10,10);
    x += 20;
  }
}
```

???

- What happens here?
- It kind of looks like the code from earlier and that it should draw squares between the left of the window and the mouse position
- But there's a trap here, which is that `mouseX` will _never change_ because we don't ever repeat the `draw()` loop
- `mouseX` will always be `0`, and so the `while` condition will always be `true`
- __Note:__ On Windows and on Linux (at least in Processing 3.3.5 and 3.3.6) it _will render_ the squares in the first frame, whereas on a Mac it will not (at least in Processing 3.3.5 and 3.3.6)

# Bean counting

- In programming, a lot of the time what we want to do with a loop is to perform some action a _set number of times_
- Basically we want the program to count up to some number, doing an action with each count
- There is a special kind of loop syntax for exactly this situation
- It's called a `for` loop

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- This `for` loop counts from `0` to `9` in the variable `i` and prints out the value of `i` each time
- So we will see "The value of i is 0", "The value of i is 1", "The value of i is 2", etc...
- Let's look at this syntax, which is a bit odd...

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- First we have the word .codeHighlight[`for`]
- It means, "this is a `for` loop", somewhat unsurprisingly

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- Next we have .codeHighlight[`(`], an opening parenthesis
- We know these days that this means "I'm going to give you the information needed to do this"
- Unlike a `while` loop, though, we give _three pieces of information_ in here

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- The first part of the information here is .codeHighlight[`int i = 0`]
- This is the _starting condition_ of our loop
- In this case we're setting up a _counting variable_ (or _iterator_) that will count the times we've gone through the loop
- Calling it `i` is very traditional
- This happens _once_ at the very beginning of the loop

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- Now we have .codeHighlight[`;`] to signal we're moving to the next piece of information
- Which is annoying, because normally we separate information commas!
- But in a for loop we separate with semicolons
- So be it

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- Now we see .codeHighlight[`i < 10`]
- This is the _condition_ for this `for` loop
- While the condition is `true` the for loop keeps going, once it's `false` the `for` loop ends
- This is _checked at the start of the loop each time_

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- Then we get .codeHightlight[`;`]
- Another day, another semicolon

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- And now our third piece of information is .codeHighlight[`i++`]
- This is the _updating_ step that will run at the _end_ of the loop each time
- In this case we are adding `1` to `i` each time through the loop
- So the first time `i` is `0`, then it's `1`, then it's `2`, and so on
- Adding `1` is the most common update step by far
- But you can do other things if you want

---

class: middle

# `for` what it's worth...

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println("The value of i is " + i);
}
```

- Finally, we have .codeHighlight[`{`], our opening curly
- Followed by the action we want to do over and over in the loop, in this case to print the value of `i`
- And at the very end we have .codeHighlight[`}`], our closing curly, to say the actions in the loop are finished

# Other `for`age

`for (int i = 0; i < 10; i += 2)`

`for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--)`

`for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i += 10)`

- And so on
- You can do whatever you want so long as you have a start condition, and end condition, and some useful update statement!

---

class: middle

# `for == while`

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  println(i);
  i++;
}
```

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  println(i);
}
```

These are exactly the same thing.

`for` is just a bit shorter to write for the specific situation of _counting_.

---

class: middle

# Build that fence with `for`!

```java
int boardWidth = 20;
int boardHeight = 200;

void setup() {
  size(1024, 480);
  background(100,200,100);
  fill(100,80,80);
}

void draw() {
  for (int x = 0; x < width; x += boardWidth) {
    rect(x, height-boardHeight, boardWidth, boardHeight);
  }
}
```

???

- Notice how this isn't _animated_?
- That's because Processing runs the _whole for-loop_ each frame!

---

class: middle

# Scope!

---

class: middle

# Curly heaven!

- We are now in the business of using a _lot_ of curly brackets!
- For functions! For if-statements! For while-loops! For for-loops!
- And we're also using variables constantly!

- And it turns out there is a special and painful relationship between curly brackets and variables.
- It is called _scope_

---

class: middle

# The short and curly story

- Variables not inside _any_ curly brackets exist everywhere
- But variables _inside_ curly brackets _only_ exist in those curly brackets
- They _stop existing_ after the closing curly bracket!

---

class: middle

```java
void setup() {
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
}

void draw() {
  rect(x,y,10,10);
}
```

__NO!__

---

class: middle

```java
void setup() {
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
} // x and y STOP EXISTING HERE

void draw() {
  rect(x,y,10,10);
}
```

__NO!__

---

class: middle

```java
int x = 0;
int y = 0;

void setup() {

}

void draw() {
  rect(x,y,10,10);
}
```

__OKAY!__

???

- Variables declared at the top like this, outside any curly brackets, are called _global variables_
- They're fine, but they can cause trouble, so be aware that they're "a thing"
- We'll come back to this with object-oriented programming later on

---

class: middle

```java
if (9 < 10) {
  boolean nineIsLessThanTen = true;
}

if (nineIsLessThanTen) {
  println("Nine is less than ten!");
}
```

__NO!__

---

class: middle

```java
if (9 < 10) {
  boolean nineIsLessThanTen = true;
} // nineIsLessThanTen STOPS EXISTING HERE!

if (nineIsLessThanTen) {
  println("Nine is less than ten!");
}
```

__NO!__

# Food for thought

- Loops reveal a kind of scary, Terminator-like aspect of computation
- The program is prepared to go on forever, until the end of the world, _it will not be stopped_
- If you say, "Hey, Processing, let's print all the numbers starting from zero, one each frame", then Processing will go ahead and do that
- Until you die.

---

class: middle

```java
int counter = 0;

void setup() {
  size(1000,500);
  fill(255);
  stroke(255);
}

void draw() {
  background(0);
  textSize(100);
  textAlign(CENTER,CENTER);
  text(counter,width/2,height/2);
  counter++;
}
```

???

- Here is some code to keep you company...
- ... FOREVER!!
- Although the `int` variable `counter` will also reach its maximum value of `2147483647`
- Which will take about 414 days at 60fps

# Programs get big

- As soon as we want to do something even slightly impressive our programs start to get pretty complicated
- We have to write a lot of code to achieve what we want
- We need some way to deal with this level of complexity

---

class: middle

# Yay! Abstraction!

- Consider `rect(0,0,100,100);`
- We understand this as "draw a rectangle with its top left corner at 0,0 and a width and height of 100"
- But of course there's a _lot_ going on behind the scenes to transform that one line of code into an actual rectangle in our window...

---

class: middle

# `rect(0,0,100,100);`

- We call `rect(0,0,100,100);`
- In the Processing library it calls _another_ kind of `rect()` function
- That calls `rectImpl()`
- That one calls `quad()`
- Which calls `beginShape()` and `vertex()`
- And `vertex()` sets elements in an array called `vertices`
- ... and on and on it goes
--

- Thank god we don't need to know all that and can just say "draw a rectangle"

---

class: middle

# We're on a need-to-know basis

- In programming we only want to know as much as we _need_ to know to get our work done
- Computation is all about _hiding_ the details when they're irrelevant
- This ability to ignore those details frees us up to do more, better, and more creative work
- Now, of course, we know more than we used to - we know about the code level

---

class: middle

# It would be nice to hide things from ourselves!

- Given how helpful it is to have all the details of `rect()` hidden...
- ... it would be nice if we could use this trick of hiding stuff ourselves
- We already do this with variables in some sense, hiding changing numbers inside names
- But we could think more clearly about our code if we could tidy it up based on what it does

---

class: middle

# doThatThingYouDo();

- It will not surprise you to learn that we _can_ hide things from ourselves
- Just like we use the `rect()` function to draw a rectangle without know how it works...
- ... we can define our _own_ functions to organise our code

class: middle

# Well, that worked, but...

- As soon as we wanted to basically do the same thing twice our code started looking pretty stupid
- We're so obviously doing _almost_ the same thing twice, shouldn't there just be a way to call `drawAvatar()`?
- Well yes there is, __obviously__.

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}
```

---

class: middle

# Okay, fine.

- Apparently our `drawAvatar()` doesn't exist as a function in Processing
--

- __Yet!__
--

- We're going to have to define it ourselves so we can use it

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {

}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}

void drawAvatar() {

  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);

  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- Here is a function definition for our avatar

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {

  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);

  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- It comes _after_ our `draw()` function

???

- This is a stylistic choice - you _can_ put the function _above_ where it is called, but people tend not to do that

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {

}

void drawAvatar() {
  int avatarX = width/2;
  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- First we write .codeHighlight[`void`]. We'll explain that soon! I swear!

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}

void drawAvatar() {
  int avatarX = width/2;
  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- Next we have the _name_ of the function, .codeHighlight[`drawAvatar`]

???

- Note how this is a _good name_ for the function because it describes clearly _what it does_

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}

void drawAvatar() {
  int avatarX = width/2;
  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- Next is .codeHighlight[`()`] - empty parentheses. This function needs no extra information.

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}

void drawAvatar() {
  int avatarX = width/2;
  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- Then we have .codeHighlight[`{`], meaning "I'm about to tell you what code this function runs"

---

class: middle

# Defining a function

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);

  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- Then we have the 9 lines of code that execute the function! (Could be more! Could be less!)

  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

- And we finish off with our .codeHighlight[`}`] to say the function is now _defined_

---

class: middle

# It works!

- We have now _abstracted_ the idea of "draw an avatar" into our function
- Notice how our `draw()` now looks _even more clear than before_
- It literally says what it is going to do: draw an avatar
- This idea of moving blocks of related code into functions to make your programs clearer is a huge win

---

class: middle

# Flow...

- The program starts with `setup()` and runs the code there
- Then it jumps to `draw()` and starts running that code
- It gets to `drawAvatar()`, our function, and jumps to _that_ function
- It runs the code inside `drawAvatar()` then jumps _back_ to where it was in `draw()`
- Then it hits the end of `draw()` and jumps back to the top of `draw()` for the next frame
- And on it goes...

---

class: middle

# All neat and tidy!

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
  setupAvatar();
  setupWorld();
}

void draw() {
  updatePhysics();
  handleInput();
  drawWorld();
  drawAvatar();
  checkWinState();
}

// Actual definitions of those functions would be down here...
```

- We can imagine programs where everything is in functions!
- `draw()` becomes a nice story of what happens in the program

---

class: middle

# All neat and tidy!

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
  setupAvatar();
  setupWorld();
}

void draw() {
  updatePhysics();
  handleInput();
  drawWorld();
  drawAvatar();
  checkWinState();
}

// Actual definitions of those functions would be down here...
```

- We know where to look for specific kinds of problems now
- And we can comment out functions to check for issues

???

- The avatar isn't drawing properly? You should probably check `drawAvatar()`!
- Want to see the avatar without the world? Comment out `drawWorld()`!

---

class: middle

# Okay, but I still want those two avatars...

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
  drawAvatar();
}

void drawAvatar() {
  int avatarX = width/2;
  int avatarY = height/2;
  int avatarSize = 100;
  fill(255);
  ellipse(avatarX,avatarY,avatarSize,avatarSize);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(avatarX - avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse(avatarX + avatarSize/4,avatarY,avatarSize/8,avatarSize/8);
  ellipse (avatarX,avatarY + avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4,avatarSize/4);
}
```

---

class: middle

# Oh, right.

- We can call `drawAvatar()` twice, and it works
- But it draws the avatar in the _same place_ both times

---

class: middle

# Information

- Lots of functions only make sense if you can give them _information_
- We don't get a rectangle if we just call `rect();` because it doesn't make sense
- We call `rect(0,0,100,100);` and specify _where_ the rectangle should be and what _dimensions_ it should have
- We want something like that for `drawAvatar()`

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Here is `drawAvatar()` again, this time with _arguments_

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- It's exactly the same, but now we have something _inside the parentheses_
- And the code in the function has changed a bit too

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- First we have .codeHighlight[`int x`]
- This means the function wants to be given or _passed_ an `int`
- That `int` will be called `x` inside the function
- It specifies the x position of the avatar being drawn
- It's just like a variable

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Then we have a .codeHighlight[`,`] - a comma
- As you might expect, we use the comma to _separate arguments_
- Because `drawAvatar()` takes multiple arguments

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Then we have a .codeHighlight[`int y`]
- This is the argument that will specify the y position of the avatar being drawn by the function
- Again, it's like a variable inside the function

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Another comma before we get our final argument

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Then we have a .codeHighlight[`int size`]
- This is the argument that specifes the _size_ of our avatar

---

class: middle

# Defining functions with arguments

```java
void drawAvatar(int x, int y, int size) {
  fill(255);
  ellipse(x,y,size,size);
  fill(0);
  ellipse(x - size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse(x + size/4,y,size/8,size/8);
  ellipse (x,y + size/4,size/4,size/4);
}
```

- Inside the _code_ of the function we can see that we are using the arguments just like variables
- But it's different now because the function doesn't know what values they have
- It has to wait until it is called and is given the information required

---

class: middle

# Calling a function with arguments

```java
void draw() {
  drawAvatar();
}
```

- If we try to call our function like this now, what will happen?
--

- Yep. Doesn't work.
- Because now that function needs _information_
- So we need to put _parameters_ into our function call

---

class: middle

# Calling a function with arguments

```java
void draw() {
  drawAvatar(width/2,height/2,100);
}
```

- Voilà! Now we can draw an avatar!

---

class: middle

# Calling a function with arguments

```java
void draw() {
  drawAvatar(width/4,height/2,100);
  drawAvatar(3*width/4,height/2,200);
}
```

- Even better! We can draw _two_ avatars in different places using the parameters!
- Notice, too, how we don't need to be able to _see_ the `drawAvatar()` function definition itself
- So long as we _know how it works_
- This is a strong case for _good documentation_ like sensible comments that explain your functions!

---

class: middle

# Functions with _results_

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  tripleTheWidth(w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,w,w);
}

void tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- Sometimes we want functions that _change_ something
- What will this do?

---

class: middle

# Functions with _results_

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  tripleTheWidth(w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,w,w);
}

void tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- The `int w` inside `draw()` is __not the same__ as the `int w` in `tripleTheWidth()`!
- The function _does_ triple a `w`, just _not the one we wanted_

---

class: middle

# Functions with _results_

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  tripleTheWidth(w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,w,w);
}

void tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- That's because when we call `tripleTheWidth(w);` Processing passes through the _value inside_ `w`
- Not the variable itself

---

class: middle

# Many happy returns...

- If we can send things into a function (with parameters/arguments), surely we can get things out?
- Well, yes, __obviously__ we can, geez.
- This is particularly helpful if we have a function that _calculates_ something
- Or perhaps a function that can _check_ something for us and report back

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` sucks

```java
void tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- It _does_ triple the value passed in as the argument
- But it doesn't _give it back_ after its tripled
- Pointless!

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` sucks

```java
void tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- Finally we're going to talk about that .codeHighlight[`void`] at the start of the function definition
- That `void` means "this function doesn't give anything back"
- And if we can write `void` to mean that, maybe we can write something else to _give something back_...
- Like... what?

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` still sucks?

```java
int tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
}
```

- If, instead of `void` we write .codeHighlight[`int`] we're saying "this function gives you back an integer"
- So that bit in front of the function definition is the _return type_
- It tells us the _kind of thing_ this function gives back
- But this doesn't work... why?

???

- Right, if we put this in Processing it complains because we _still don't give it back_

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` doesn't suck?

```java
int tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
  return w;
}
```

- In order to give something back we need to `return` it inside the function
- We do this by writing `return` and then the thing we want to return, like the resulting argument `w`
- The thing we `return` has to match the _type_ we said we would return at the front of the function definition (an `int` in this case)
- Now Processing doesn't complain

---

class: middle

# Damn you `tripleTheWidth`!!!

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  tripleTheWidth(w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,w,w);
}

int tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
  return w;
}
```

- THIS STILL DOESN'T WORK??? WHYYYYY???
--

- Yeah, because we don't actually _use_ the value `tripleTheWidth` is trying to give back

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` you beautiful function you!

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  w = tripleTheWidth(w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,w,w);
}

int tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
  return w;
}
```

- We need to _receive_ the value calculated by `tripleTheWidth`
- We can put it back into the `w` variable for instance

---

class: middle

# `tripleTheWidth` you beautiful function you!

```java
void setup() {
  size(640,480);
}

void draw() {
  int w = 100;
  ellipse(width/4,height/2,w,w);
  ellipse(3*width/4,height/2,tripleTheWidth(w),tripleTheWidth(w));
}

int tripleTheWidth(int w) {
  w = w * 3;
  return w;
}
```

- Or we can use it directly wherever we want to use the _value it calculates_
- So we can imagine that function call being substituted with the _value_ that is `return`ed

---

class: middle

# More useful?


```java
void setup() {
  size(500,500);
}

void draw() {
  color bgColour = randomColour(0,255);
  color fgColour = randomColour(100,200);
  background(bgColour);
  fill(fgColour);
  ellipse(250,250,250,250);
}

color randomColour(int low, int high) {
  float r = random(low,high);
  float g = random(low,high);
  float b = random(low,high);
  return color(r,g,b);
}
```

???

- Obviously we don't really need functions that do things like `tripleTheWidth`
- We generally want functions that calculate something more useful

# Modularity and reuse!

There are two main reasons why functions are so great, and they have special names!

Functions are __modular__. We can tidy our code into separate, self-contained blocks that make sense as a unit. Our code becomes more organised, more readable, easier to fix.

Functions are __reusable__. We can use a function over and over again without writing out all the code in it. This makes our programming more efficient and less lengthy. It's like free code!

---

class: middle

# Food for thought

- With functions it's like we suddenly have this team of different workers who we can ask to do specific things for us whenever we want
- Sometimes we give them some information so they can do their job (parameters / arguments)
- Sometimes they come back and give us some information that they worked out (return values)

The weird thing is that these workers are all also... _us_.

???

- Because we write those functions, right? Get it? Deep.

# The [Midterm Project](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2017/wiki/Midterm-Project)

- It's here!
- We can take a look at it!
- Note that it uses coding ideas we will learn __next week__ but which you can read about __now__
- That is: object oriented programming (OOP) (see chapter 8 of _Learning Processing_)
- Also note that [Exercise 02](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2017/wiki/Exercise-02), assigned this week, uses a lot of the ideas in the Midterm, so you can play around with that while you're learning OOP

---

class: middle

# The Final Project

Just a reminder that we'll have an open-brief final project running for the final six weeks of the course.

It's worth keeping in the back of your mind in case you have ideas for it now - write them down!

Also take note if you find some specific programming concept interesting (whether it's physics, metaphysics, or something else), you might not remember later.
