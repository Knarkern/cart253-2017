#### What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from the deck of cards?

1. There are 52 cards, including 4 aces, in a standard deck.
2. The probability of drawing an ace on your first pull is therefore **4/52**.
3. The probability of drawing an ace on your second pull is **3/51**, because there is one less ace and one less card in the deck.
5. The probability of drawing two aces in a row is therefore **(4/52) * (3/51)** which is **0.004524886878**.
6. Which means the probability is about **0.45%** - not very likely!
