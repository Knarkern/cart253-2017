*Run any Processing sketch in the default renderer, then switch to P2D and P3D. Notice any difference?*

On my computer both the P2D and P3D renderers have a slightly larger start-up time. Other than that, they rendered the same. (I was running the example code from Processing called `BackgroundImage`.)
