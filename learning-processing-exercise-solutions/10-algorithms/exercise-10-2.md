### Breaking *Fitts's Law* into parts

1. Write a program that makes a rectangle appear in a random location on the screen
2. Create a Button class that allows you to hover, unhover, and click a button with a label
3. Combine 1 and 2 to have a button appear in a random location on the screen and make it disappear when clicked
4. Write code to make a number count down from a random number back to 0
5. Add a label to the Button class that displays a score given in the constructor, make the score (and label) go down to 0, when it reaches 0 make the button disappear
6. Add a player score so that if you successfully click the button it returns the amount of score to add to the player's score
7. Add the ability to display a new button after a button has either been clicked or disappeared by reaching 0, keep track of how many buttons have been displayed in a variable (kind of like the 'level' of the game)
8. Add the ability to display a 'fake' button that doesn't actually have a score associated with it (maybe need a boolean in the constructor for whether or not a button is fake?)
9. At a certain level of play, start display a number of fake buttons along with the real button
