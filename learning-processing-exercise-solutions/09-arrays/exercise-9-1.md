## Sketches that could benefit from arrays...

* Exercise 4.4 could possibly have used an array of ellipse objects, but there are only four so it probably wasn't worth it.
* Exercise 5.1 could conceivably use an array of grades
* Exercise 5.6 could possibly have an array of rectangle objects to clean up the code
* Exercise 7.6 would probably better with an array of flower objects
* Exercise 7.10 would be better with an array of spaceship objects
* Exercise 8.6 could use an array of Zoog objects
